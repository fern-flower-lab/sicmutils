;; ## Noether Theorem Support

;; F-tilde is a parametric coordinate transformation that given parameters takes
;; a state and returns transformed coordinates. F-tilde may take an arbitrary
;; number of real-valued parameters. F-tilde applied to zeros is the coordinate
;; selector: It takes a state and returns the coordinates. The hypothesis of
;; Noether's theorem is that the Lagrangian is invariant under the
;; transformation for all values of the parameters.

;; (D (lambda parms (compose L (F->C (apply F-tilde parms))))) = 0
